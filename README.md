## What is this?

This is a collection of [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/docs/intro/) T5/BO1 scripts I created, written in [GSC](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/gsc/).  

Huge thanks to everyone who helped me learn GSC: Birchy, DoktorSAS, FutureRave and other people on Discord.


## How do I download a script?

- [Download this repository](https://github.com/Resxt/Plutonium-T5-Scripts/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Open the downloaded ZIP file
- Drag and drop the script(s) you want in the folder they need to be placed in.  
If no instructions are provided for the script you want then simply follow the instructions given in [How do I use a script?](#how-do-i-use-a-script)

Just keep in mind that this downloads a copy of this repository at the moment you download it.  
If a script is updated after you downloaded this repository and you want the new version then you will need to download this repository again.

## How do I use a script?

Open the start menu and go to `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t5`.  
If the script should be loaded for both the multiplayer and the zombies mode then drop the file in the `scripts` folder.  
If the script should only be loaded for the multiplayer mode then put it in `scripts\mp`.  
If the script should only be loaded for the zombies mode then put it in `scripts\sp\zom`.  

Note that you can use `map_restart` in the [console](https://plutonium.pw/docs/opening-console/) to quickly restart your current game and reload scripts.
